Little information:
In this repo I will post my different experiments, such as "Attept to create Residual Network", "GoogLeNet", "SegNet based on RestNet", "YOLO algorithm in work" and so on.
Maybe there will be sentence classification, translators, speech recognization, notebooks about RNN,GRU,LSTM and Conv1D.
For today, I posted my scratch ResNet50 that trains on MNIST database.
Soon, I will upload GoogLeNet example, too.
Thank you for reading until end.
Wish you good day and happy hacking for everybody.


P.S. About my project
I want to create AI project that could be useful in recycling and in cleaning enviroment. Main part will be on "WebSite" and AI, too. The goal of model is to detect trash, classify its material and bound it with bounding box. We wiil use it in recycling places where we can replace humans. We will have one main conveyer and there willl be trash on it. Then we will have Camera that should take a picture and give it to website and website to AI and afer that, AI will classify. Lets suppose that we have n material types. Then there will be n braching of main conveyer and their output will be pit for each one. From that pit each truck will take trash and carry them on recycling. There are many technique from each material.
